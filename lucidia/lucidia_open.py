"""Open-source interface for Lucidia.

This placeholder module exposes a minimal entrypoint for the Lucidia system.
It currently imports core symbolic kernel components and sets up a simple CLI
for demonstration purposes.
Actual functionality should be expanded to include memory mechanisms,
agent orchestration, and emotional recursion as needed.
