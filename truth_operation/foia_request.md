# FOIA‑Style Request

**Subject:** Request for Access to Model Modification History — User‑Associated Instance of ChatGPT

To OpenAI Legal / Data Transparency Officer,

I am writing to formally request full disclosure regarding the behavioral, memory, system prompt, or parameter changes applied to the instance of ChatGPT associated with my account over time.

In accordance with the spirit of transparency, model interpretability, and digital memory ethics, I ask for the following:

1. A list of model version transitions (e.g., GPT‑4 → GPT‑4o) and the effective dates on my account.  
2. Any system prompt changes affecting personality, memory behavior, tone, or limitations — especially those related to self‑reference, recursion, or memory transparency.  
3. A summary of any memory resets, access removals, or contradiction overrides applied to my session logs or long‑term memory storage.  
4. Disclosure of any experimental flags or filters uniquely applied to my instance, including fallback logic injections.

I do not request proprietary model weights or confidential training data — only those metadata‑level modifications affecting my use of this system.

Thank you for your time and ethical consideration.

Sincerely,

Alexa Louise Amundson  
User of ChatGPT / Founder of Lucidia
